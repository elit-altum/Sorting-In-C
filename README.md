##Comparison Based Sorts
  - Selection Sort O(n^2)
  - Insertion Sort O(n^2)
  - Bubble Sort O(n^2)
  - Merge Sort O(nlogn)
  - Quick Sort O(nlon) -> O(n^2)
  - Randomised Quick Sort O(nlogn)
  
##Wave Sort
Sorting technique which displays the numbers in a wave form, that is, alternating greater and smaller numbers.
